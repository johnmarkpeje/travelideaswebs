					<h3>It is an investment that equips a person with practical knowledge. Travelling also keeps away stress, depression, and anxiety. It provides a new atmosphere taking out a person from their comfort zone. Overall, traveling broadens the horizon of a person. Travel takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see, taste and try new things. It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with different people, to embrace adventures as they come and to share new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones.<h3>
